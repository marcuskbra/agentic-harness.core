/**
 * Whether the page the server sent is the page the person got.
 *
 * A hydration mismatch ships silently: the markup is valid, the
 * console line scrolls past, and the visitor sees content flash,
 * flip or vanish. The judgment here is over three kinds of
 * evidence: content in the server render that is gone after
 * hydration, content that only exists after hydration, and the
 * framework's own hydration warnings caught in the console.
 *
 * Framework-agnostic on purpose. The console recognizers know
 * the words React and Vue use, but the DOM comparison knows
 * nothing about any framework: a server render and a hydrated
 * document disagree or they do not.
 *
 * Adapted from the hydration-safety check in Carolyn McNeillie's
 * review-page skill set, generalized from its React framing.
