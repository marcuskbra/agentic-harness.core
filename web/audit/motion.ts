/**
 * Whether the page honours a request for reduced motion.
 *
 * The preference is the one accessibility setting a page can
 * ignore without failing a single axe rule: the markup is fine,
 * the contrast is fine, and the page is still unusable for the
 * person who asked it to hold still. The only way to know is to
 * ask for reduce and then look at what is still moving, which is
 * what this module judges from a capture taken under emulation.
 *
 * The analysis is pure and takes serialized data, like every
 * other audit here: nothing in this file can start a browser.
 *
 * Adapted from the reduced-motion conventions in Carolyn
 * McNeillie's review-page skill set, which treats a page that
 * ignores the preference outright as one of the few
 * symptom-only blockers: user-observable, confirmed from the
 * capture, no mechanism claim required.
