/**
 * How text blocks end: orphans and runts, from real layout.
 *
 * A single word stranded on the last line of a paragraph or
 * heading reads as a typesetting accident, and a very short last
 * line nearly does. Neither can be judged from markup or font
 * metrics, because where the browser broke the lines is the
 * fact, so the capture reads actual line boxes word by word
 * through Range.getBoundingClientRect.
 *
 * This is taste, not conformance: nothing here fails a
 * standard, and the verdict never goes past WARN. It sits in
 * the design domain beside the inventory for the same reason
 * the inventory does: it reports what a person would want to
 * polish, and the judgment of whether it matters is theirs.
 *
 * The line-reading approach is ported from the orphans-and-runts
 * check in Carolyn McNeillie's review-page skill set, including
 * its exclusions: text the author already asked the browser to
 * balance is the browser's business, and text inside a collapsed
 * disclosure is not laid out at all.
