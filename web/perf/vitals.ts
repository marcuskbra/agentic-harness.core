 * What the page cost the person waiting for it.

 * contentful paint and layout shift are defined by what the
 * renderer did, not by anything measurable from outside.
 *
 * What this module adds is the arithmetic the observers leave to
 * the caller, and one piece of it matters more than the rest.
 * Cumulative layout shift is not the sum of every shift, though
 * summing is the obvious reading of the name. It is the largest
 * sum within a session window, so a page that shifts a little
 * every few seconds over a long visit is not punished as though
 * it had shifted once, enormously.
