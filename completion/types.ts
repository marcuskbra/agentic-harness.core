/**
 * Type surface for the side-completion boundary.
 *
 * `CompleteSimple` is the port: this package has no way to run a
 * model itself, so `runSideCompletion` and `runInvestigation` both
 * take one as a parameter and call it rather than reaching for a
 * concrete backend. `CompatModule` names the shape an adapter gets
 * back from dynamically importing its own completion function
 * (pi's is `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat`'s `completeSimple`,
 * reached that way because pi's own typecheck dependency resolves
 * an older pi-ai where the subpath does not exist); a host with no
 * such subpath quirk can just pass a function of the same shape.
